# linkedin_clean

This repository is for cleaning up comments and posts in your linkedin account.


### Comments ###
1. Go to your comments page

https://www.linkedin.com/in/YOURACCOUNTNAME/recent-activity/comments/

2. In firefox, press F12 select Console and paste in the clean_comments.js
edit last line and write your Account name, as i did, press enter.

3. Now it will clean all comments in all posts until done.

ps. in theory it can stop but then you only reload the page and do p.2 again
